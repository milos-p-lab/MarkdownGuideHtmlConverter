Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>)

The following are some guidelines to observe when creating issues or PRs:

- Use reasonable titles; refrain from using overly long or capitalized titles as they are usually annoying and do little to encourage others to help :smile:

- Be detailed; refrain from mentioning code problems without sharing your source code and always give information regarding your board and version of the library
