About
=====

   Like other people, I did not have a single concise source for all the
Amigaguide commands and how they work (or don't as the case may be).  So I
decided to write one.  I believe I have covered all the commands from the
earliest Amigaguide to the latest (release 3.1 of AmigaOS).

   I've also considered writting more about how to work with Amigaguide as
a programer (how to work with dynamic hosts, the Amigaguide Datatype, etc),
but that will only come later if there is a demand.  I also thought about
doing a general tutorial on writting Amigaguide documents (or Texinfo
documents for that matter).

   I don't claim to be any expert on Amigaguide, but, I do think I do a
fairly good job at rounding up information and compiling it into a nice
readable form.  I hope you will agree.

Background
==========

   Amigaguide commands all begin with the '@' (pronounced 'at') symbol.
Most commands must start at the very begining of a line, and should be the
only thing that is on that line.  Although not required for most commands,
you should probably write them all in capital letters as a matter of
discipline (it also makes them much easier to see and keep track of!).

   There are three catagories of commands:  Global, Node, and Attributes.
Global commands are usualy specified at the begining of the document,
before any nodes are defined, and apply to all the nodes in the document.
Technicaly, they could be anywhere.  Many commands can be used both globaly
and in nodes.

   Node commands are usable inside of a node (after a '@NODE' and before an
"@ENDNODE"), and affect only the node in which they are used.

   Attributes may be specified anywhere in a normal line.  In addition to
the '@' symbol, attributes always use a pair of braces ('{' and '}') to
enclose the attribute name and possibly additional arguments.

   Many commands have been introduced over time, so some commands require a
minimum OS version.  These commands may be used without too much worry
about compatibility since older versions of Amigaguide largely ignore
unknown commands.  Where a command only works on more recent versions of
the OS, they will be followed by a "V39" or "V40", otherwise they work on
any Amiga.  V39 is AmigaOS/Workbench release 3.0 (only on A1200's and
A4000's), and V40 is release 3.1 (available to anyone willing to pay
through the butt for it).

   To avoid complications in viewing this document with Amigaguide, all the
commands listed will not include the necessary '@' - but don't forget it
when you are authoring an Amigaguide document!

Paths and Nodes
===============

   The commands INDEX, HELP, NEXT, PREV, TOC and the all purpose hypertext
link specify other nodes to jump to.  They all support the naming of nodes
within the current document, but they also all support a path along with
that name which lets the node be located in any Amigaguide document.

   It is really the essence of the simple.  To access a node in another
document, simply put an AmigaDOS file path before the node name.  You do
not need a complete path including a volume name, if you are sure that the
file is going to be where it should be (generaly, if it is not in the same
directory as the main document, you should use a full path, maybe an
assigned volume name).  Some example paths are:  "s:help.guide/main",
"Amigaguide.guide/Copyright".

   If you are running AmigaOS 3.0 or above, you can jump to any file that is
supported by Datatypes - pictures, animation, anything.  You must still
give a "node" name, even though the file is not an Amigaguide file and has
no "nodes" - so just use "main":  "picture.iff/main".

Global Commands
***************

Global Commands
===============

<b>$VER: &lt;AmigaDOS version string&gt;</b>
     Specify an Amiga standard version string.  "VER" must be uppercase.
     The format for an Amiga version string is:  &lt;name&gt; (mm/dd/yy).  If you
     have this in your Amigaguide file, you can use the AmigaDOS command
     "Version" to get the string.

<b>(C) &lt;copyright&gt;</b>
     Specify a copyright notice for this file.

<b>AUTHOR &lt;name&gt;</b>
     Specify the author of this file.

<b>DATABASE &lt;name&gt;</b>
     Identifies this file as an Amigaguide document.  Must be the very first
     thing in the file!

<b>DNODE &lt;name&gt;</b>
     This is an obsolete command, do not use.  It used to be for indicating
     a "dynamic node", but is not needed because the Amigaguide system will
     search for a node that doesn't exist, at which point a dynamic node
     host can return the node.

<b>ENDNODE</b>
     Specify the end of a hypertext node definition.

<b>FONT &lt;name&gt; &lt;size&gt;</b>
     Specify the font to use for the database.

<b>HEIGHT &lt;rows&gt;</b>
     The number of rows in the largest node.

<b>HELP  </b>
     Specify a help node accessible with the "Help" button.

<b>INDEX &lt;path/node&gt;</b>
     Specify an index node accessible with the "Index" button.

<b>MACRO &lt;name&gt; &lt;commands&gt;</b>
     Define a macro for this document.  A macro is made up of attribute
     commands and or other macros, and is used like other attributes.  A
     macro can override the built in attributes.  A macro can accept
     arguments by embeding a '$' symbol with a number, for each argument
     supported; IE, '$1', '$2', etc.  If an argument is given when using
     the macro, but is not defined in the macro, then it simply doesn't
     appear, which might be usefull to somebody.  V40.

	     Example:

              @macro bold "\@{b} $1 \@{ub}"
                ...
          
              This is an example of a @{bold "bold"} macro.

<b>MASTER &lt;path&gt;</b>
     Specifies the AmigaDOS file path of the original document this
     Amigaguide file was derived from.

<b>NODE &lt;name&gt; &lt;title&gt;</b>
     Specify the beginning of a hypertext node definition.

<b>ONCLOSE &lt;rxcommand&gt;</b>
     Specify an ARexx script to execute when this document is closed.  The
     script's return value is not significant.  V40.

<b>ONOPEN &lt;rxcommand&gt;</b>
     Specify an ARexx script to execute when this document is opened.  The
     document will not be opened if the script returns an error.  V40.

<b>REM &lt;remark&gt;</b>
<b>REMARK &lt;remark&gt;</b>
     Used to place a remark in the document which is not displayed.

<b>SMARTWRAP</b>
     A more inteligent word wrapping algorithm than WORDWRAP.  Paragraphs
     must be separated by two line feeds (visualy, a blank line).  V40.

<b>TAB &lt;num&gt;</b>
     Define the size in spaces of a tab.  Defaults to 8.  V40.

<b>WIDTH &lt;chars&gt;</b>
     The number of columns in the largest node.

<b>WORDWRAP</b>
     Use wordwrapping for all paragraphs.  To be wordwrapped, the paragraph
     must have no line feeds.  V39.  Since this is ugly to work with, and
     ugly to look at in Amigaguide 2.x and lower, you should use SMARTWRAP
     and write your Amigaguide files to look wordwrapped - this makes your
     document look decent on all systems while taking advantage of V40 and
     above since SMARTWRAP will be ignored on pre-V40 Amiga's.

Node Commands
*************

Node Commands
=============

<b>\ </b>
     Sometimes it is necessary to be able to use the '@' symbol in your
     document.  To prevent it from being interpreted as a command, use the
     '\' to escape it:  '\@'.  To use a '\\' itself, you must also escape
     it: '\\'.

<b>FONT &lt;name&gt; &lt;size&gt;</b>
     Specify the font to use for this node.  The name must be the complete
     name of the font, IE:  "times.font".

<b>HELP &lt;path/node&gt;</b>
     Specify a help node accessible with the "Help" button.

<b>INDEX &lt;path/node&gt;</b>
     Specify a help node accessible with the "Help" button.

<b>KEYWORDS &lt;keywords&gt;</b>
     Keywords for this node.  Not currently used by Amigaguide.

<b>MACRO &lt;name&gt; &lt;commands&gt;</b>
     Same as the global version.

<b>NEXT &lt;path/node&gt;</b>
     Define the next logical node (if not physicaly located right after this
     one) accessible with the "Browse &gt;" button.

<b>ONCLOSE &lt;rxcommand&gt;</b>
     Specify an ARexx script to execute when this node is closed.  The
     script's return value is not significant.  V40.

<b>ONOPEN &lt;rxcommand&gt;</b>
     Specify an ARexx script to execute when this node is opened.  The node
     will not be opened if the script returns an error.  V40.

<b>PREV &lt;path/node&gt;</b>
     Define the previous logical node (if not physicaly located right before
     this one) accessible with the "&lt; Browse" button.

<b>SMARTWRAP</b>
     Same as the global version, but only effective for this node.  Note:
     No matter where SMARTWRAP appears in the node, it will effect the
     <i>entire</i> node.

<b>TAB &lt;num&gt;</b>
     Define the size in spaces of a tab.  Defaults to 8.  V40.

<b>TITLE &lt;title&gt;</b>
     Specifies the title of this node, which is displayed in the title bar
     of the window when this node is selected.  Must begin at the start of
     a line.

<b>TOC &lt;path/name&gt;</b>
     Specifies the table of contents for this node (the default is the node
     "MAIN") accessible with the "Contents" button.

<b>WORDWRAP</b>
     Same as the global version, but only effective for this node.

Attribute Commands
******************

Attribute Commands
==================

<b>{&lt;label&gt; &lt;command&gt;}</b>
     Specify a hypertext link.  Not really an attribute per se, but shares a
     similar syntax and scope.  It may be specified anywhere on a line.

     The command is usualy "LINK", to specify a normal hypertext link.
     There are other commands as follows:

    <b>ALINK &lt;path/name&gt; &lt;line&gt;</b>
          Display the hypertext node in a new window, starting at &lt;line&gt;.
          This no longer works in V39 and up (why not??).

    <b>CLOSE</b>
          Close the window, to be used with ALINK windows.  Doesn't work in
          V39 and up.

    <b>LINK &lt;path/name&gt; &lt;line&gt;</b>
          Display the hypertext node, starting at &lt;line&gt;.

    <b>RX &lt;command&gt;</b>
          Execute an ARexx script.

    <b>RXS &lt;command&gt;</b>
          Execute an ARexx string file.

    <b>SYSTEM &lt;command&gt;</b>
          Execute an AmigaDOS command.

    <b>QUIT</b>
          Shutdown the current database.  Doesn't work in V39 and up.

     The node is the name of a node in this document, or a path to a node in
     another document.  In AmigaOS 3.0 and above, the node may be a path to
     any type of file which is recognized by the Datatypes system.

<b>{AMIGAGUIDE}</b>
     Displays the word "Amigaguide(R)" in bold.  V40.

    <b>Background</b>
    <b>Highlight</b>
<b>{BODY}</b>
     Restore default formatting for normal body text.  V40.

     Turn on centered justification.  V40.

<b>{JLEFT}</b>
     Turn on left justification.  V40.

<b>{JRIGHT}</b>
     Turn on right justification.  V40.

<b>{LINDENT &lt;n&gt;}</b>
     Specify an indent in spaces for the body of paragraphs.  V40.

<b>{LINE}</b>
     Force a line feed without starting a new paragraph.  V40.

<b>{PAR}</b>
     Specifies the end of the paragraph, equivalent to two line feeds and
     usable with SMARTWRAP.  V40.

<b>{PARD}</b>
     Reset to default paragraph settings:  APEN to 1, BPEN to 0, original
     font, and LINDENT to 0.  V40.

<b>{PARI &lt;n&gt;}</b>
     Specify an indent in spaces for the first line of a paragraph.  Value
     is relative to LINDENT and may be negative.  V40.
