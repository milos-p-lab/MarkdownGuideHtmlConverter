# Why I Built a C# Markdown to/from HTML, and AmigaGuide to HTML Converter

> **Description:** "A lightweight, safe and complete `.md` to `.html`, `.html` to `.md`, `.txt` to `.html`, `.html` to `.txt`, and `.guide` to `.html` converter built in C#, and why existing tools like Pandoc and Typora didn't meet my needs."

## üöÄ Introducing the Markdown to HTML Converter You Didn‚Äôt Think Was Possible

> ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd told me a year ago that it‚Äôs possible to build a faster and fully standards-compliant Markdown-to-HTML converter than Pandoc‚Äîin a single C# file, with built-in XSS protection, working on both .NET Framework and .NET 7/8/9‚ÄîI honestly wouldn‚Äôt have believed it myself. So I built it to prove it can be done.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always admired tools like Pandoc for their power. But I wanted:

- Blazing fast conversion speed, even for documents hundreds of pages long.
- Smaller footprint, without pulling in hundreds of MB of dependencies.
- Full compatibility across .NET Framework and modern .NET versions.
- W3C-valid HTML output‚Äîno broken markup, no surprises.
- Built-in security, to make sure no malicious Markdown can slip through and cause XSS vulnerabilities.
- No external tools, no native binaries, no complex installs.

In my personal and professional work, I needed a reliable Markdown to HTML converter that could:

- Be embedded in **console, desktop, or web applications**
- Produce **clean, W3C-valid HTML5**
- Offer **full feature support**, including task lists, footnotes, tables, TOC, etc.
- Provide **XSS protection** out-of-the-box
- Remain **small, fast, and dependency-free**

After trying several popular tools ‚Äî Pandoc, Typora, VS Code Markdown preview ‚Äî I ran into limitations I couldn‚Äôt accept.

## üîç Why Not Use Pandoc or Typora?

These tools are powerful. But they weren't right for my needs:

| Tool    | Limitations                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pandoc  | Heavy binary, slow execution, poor table rendering, no task lists |
| Typora  | Lacks XSS protection, doesn't support multi-line footnotes, inconsistent HTML |
| VS Code | Basic preview only, no customization                         |

When you care about **structure, safety, and full feature coverage**, even powerful tools fall short.

As someone who needed a fast, embeddable Markdown to / from HTML converter in **C#**, I couldn't find anything that met all of these goals:

‚úÖ Small and dependency-free  
‚úÖ Fully supports advanced Markdown (TOC, footnotes, tables, tasks...)  
‚úÖ XSS-safe and robust for user input  
‚úÖ Easy to integrate into **console**, **desktop**, or **web apps**

So I built it.

## Markdown to HTML Converter

### ‚úÖ Markdown Supported Features

- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
- Heading underlining (e.g., `Heading\n===` for H1 or `Heading\n---` for H2)
- Basic text styles (**bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, ==highlighted==)
- Subscript and superscript (e.g., `H~2~O`, `E=mc^2^`)
- Multi-level **ordered lists** and **unordered lists**
- Mixed nesting of **ordered and unordered lists**
- **Task lists** (with checkbox states)
- Blockquotes
- Code blocks (**code fences**)
  - fenced code blocks (e.g., ```csharp)
  - indented code blocks (e.g., indented by 4 spaces or a tab)
- **Inline code**
- Horizontal rules
- **Links**
- **Images**
- **Tables**  
  - Column alignment (left / center / right)
- **Footnotes**  
  - Clickable references and backlinks

  - Embedding arbitrary HTML tags inside Markdown
  - Self-closing tags (e.g. `<br>`)
  - Audio/video tags for media embedding
- **Front matter** (YAML metadata block)  
  - Supports title and custom meta tags for HTML `<head>`
- **Table of Contents (TOC)** generation  
  - Automatically collects all headings during parsing
  - Generates hierarchical TOC as nested lists
  - Optionally inserts TOC at `[TOC]` marker in the document

‚úÖ The generated HTML code is **valid according to W3C standards**, verified through the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

### üîê Security Considerations

This converter includes built-in logic to detect and sanitize potentially dangerous HTML input:

- Detects and blocks tags such as `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, and other potentially unsafe HTML elements.
- Blocks dangerous attributes like `onerror`, `onclick`, `onload`, etc.
- Decodes and analyzes **HTML entity encoding** (e.g. `&#106;...`) and **URL encoding** (e.g. `%6a%61...`) to prevent obfuscated XSS attacks.
- Automatically inserts warnings for any detected issues, allowing users to fix Markdown syntax errors without breaking the conversion process.

No external libraries or HTML sanitizers are required ‚Äî the security logic is fully self-contained.

### üö® Warnings for Syntax and Security Issues

- The converter detects common Markdown syntax mistakes (e.g., unclosed **bold**, *italic*, ==highlight==, etc.).
- It also scans the input for potential XSS and phishing vulnerabilities (e.g., embedded &lt;script&gt; tags or suspicious links).
- Instead of halting the conversion, all issues are collected and displayed as a styled warning block appended to the end of the generated HTML.
- Each warning includes the line number (and optionally the position) where the issue occurred.
- Inline fallback styling is used to ensure visibility of warnings, even without custom CSS.
- This feature improves robustness, especially for automated batch conversions or unverified input sources.

It‚Äôs ideal for batch-processing Markdown or handling user-submitted content.

## ‚ö° One C# File. One Line to Use It

Instead of building a framework, I created a **single-file class** you can just drop into your project and use like this:

```csharp
string html = ConvMarkdownHtml.Convert(markdown);
```

```csharp
string markdown = ConvHtmlMarkdown.Convert(html);
```

```csharp
string html = ConvGuideHtml.Convert(amigaGuide);
```

```csharp
string html = ConvHtmlMarkdown.SmartTxtConvert(txt);
```

```csharp
string txt = ConvHtmlMarkdown.ConvertToTxt(html);
```

Done. No NuGet packages. No third-party libs. No surprises.

- Compatible with both .NET Framework 4.x and .NET 7/8/9
- Minimal footprint (just a few tens of KB)
- Supports custom CSS themes for beautiful HTML rendering
- No dependencies on external DLLs or tools like Pandoc
- üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in XSS protection** ‚Äî automatically detects dangerous tags, attributes, and obfuscated payloads for safer HTML output
